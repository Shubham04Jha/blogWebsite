This project is almost done.

TO DOs
Deployment....
marking todos in most of the code where change is necessary.
Good error handling around many api calls. (there are still uncaught errors.)
query and params.
deletion of old images once user replaces banner images.


I think are resolved:
1) deletion of all the refreshTokens once user logs out. maybe this isn't the issue cuz new login means new refreshtoken anytime. and only payload is changing as it involves the current time and then the sign also changes so yea good so far
